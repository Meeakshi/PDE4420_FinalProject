# PDE4420_FinalProject
In the final module project you will simulate a wheeled robot in a Gazebo virtual environment to move to a specified location. This motion is instructed by a node which publishes the moving command to drive the robot base. You will prepare a research report to outline your design in, but not limited to, the URDF, message transfer mechanism between publisher and subscriber, simulation in Gazebo and displaying in rviz, navigation, and coordinate frames transformation, etc. This project will be used as an overall evaluation of your learning performance, and covers the main learning outcomes in the module.
