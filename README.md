# PDE4420_FinalProject
Requirment:
In the final module project you will simulate a wheeled robot in a Gazebo virtual environment to move to a specified location. This motion is instructed by a node which publishes the moving command to drive the robot base. You will prepare a research report to outline your design in, but not limited to, the URDF, message transfer mechanism between publisher and subscriber, simulation in Gazebo and displaying in rviz, navigation, and coordinate frames transformation, etc. This project will be used as an overall evaluation of your learning performance, and covers the main learning outcomes in the module.

Outcome:
In this project report I have achieved knowledge on integration of ROS, URDF, Rviz and Gazebo to spawn a robot in a virtual environment. I could successfully build a world and familiarize turtlebot in its world. Could also programmatically move the bot in a waypoint using python programming language. This report will help reader to practice step by step on how to install ROS, create catkin work space, how to create a package, to create a gazebo world and to launch a robot in the world and make it move around in the path we define.
